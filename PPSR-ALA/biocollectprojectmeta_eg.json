A bracket is installed adjacent to the sign to designate where the camera or phone should be placed, allowing us to guarantee that all photographs are taken from the same location. The photographs will be compiled in a time lapse series, which will be used to better understand seasonal changes in G. vermiculophylla populations. The time lapses will be available for viewing by the public through the project’s blog.","getInvolved":"","urlWeb":"http://scistarter.com/project/1166-Monitoring%20an%20Invasive%20Seaweed","urlImage":"http://scistarter.com//media/projects/gracpostimage.jpg","logoCredit":"Andrew Ngeow","difficulty":"Medium","scienceType":["Nature & Outdoors","Biology","Ecology & Environment","Marine & Terrestrial","Technology"],"ecoScienceType":[],"isDIY":false,"isSciStarter":true,"hasParticipantCost":false,"equipment":"","plannedStartDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","plannedEndDate":null,"endDate":null,"coverage":{"coordinates":[-81.02797508245203,31.987991954417964],"radius":515.9334554874507,"type":"Circle"},"links":[],"startDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","url":"https://biocollect.ala.org.au/acsa/project/index/2ce1f754-ef57-403e-a01e-760e63587bd0"},{"projectId":"5ec93f80-f624-4db5-b35c-7626e1376d0c","name":"Shark Conservation in Belize","keywords":"belize,conservation,sharks","aim":"Help keep shark populations strong.","task":"Study sharks and learn how to conserve their population.","dateCreated":"2015-03-04T16:37:47Z","lastUpdated":"2016-09-13T11:23:32Z","status":"Active","managerEmail":null,"organisationName":"Earthwatch","description":"To protect sharks and their habitat, we need to know where they spend their time. This study is the first of its kind—while we have evidence that sharks do better in marine reserves, we have no idea how long a decimated population will take to recover in a brand-new reserve. That’s one of the insights that will come out of this research. The scientists are also looking for insight into how well Belize's marine reserves foster sharks, so you'll help implant transmitters in sharks to track where they go. Essentially, researchers will know marine reserves are working if sharks spend more time inside their borders than outside.","getInvolved":"","urlWeb":"http://scistarter.com/project/1143-Shark%20Conservation%20in%20Belize","urlImage":"http://scistarter.com//media/projects/shark-conservation-in-belize-c-jillian-morris-h2_5795.jpg","logoCredit":"Earthwatch","difficulty":"Medium","scienceType":["Nature & Outdoors","Animals","Ecology & Environment","Biodiversity","Marine & Terrestrial","Ocean"],"ecoScienceType":[],"isDIY":false,"isSciStarter":true,"hasParticipantCost":false,"equipment":"","plannedStartDate":"2015-05-28T00:00:00Z","plannedEndDate":"2017-01-26T00:00:00Z","endDate":"2017-01-26T00:00:00Z","coverage":{"coordinates":[[[-87.92724612168968,15.760536148501288],[-88.20190432481468,15.633616989544775],[-88.66333010606468,15.675932151334584],[-89.05883791856468,16.014136002085912],[-88.76220705918968,16.320139453117577],[-88.50952151231466,16.509832826905846],[-88.24584963731468,18.03097474989003],[-88.44360354356468,18.3336694457713],[-88.13598635606468,18.89589255941504],[-87.71850588731468,18.6670631919266],[-87.32299807481468,18.3336694457713],[-87.67456057481468,16.720385051693988],[-87.27905276231468,16.140815555276024],[-87.44384768418968,15.749962572748755],[-87.92724612168968,15.760536148501288]]],"type":"Polygon"},"links":[],"startDate":"2015-05-28T00:00:00Z","url":"https://biocollect.ala.org.au/acsa/project/index/5ec93f80-f624-4db5-b35c-7626e1376d0c"},{"projectId":"123d4798-f6fc-4e34-83f7-264b09cfa90a","name":"Reverse The Odds","keywords":"cancer,cancer research uk,citizen science,CRUK,game,gaming,health,puzzle game","aim":"To help complete a muscle-invasive bladder cancer study","task":"You'll classify bladder tumour samples on behalf of researchers","dateCreated":"2015-02-05T06:32:59Z","lastUpdated":"2016-09-12T11:34:01Z","status":"Active","managerEmail":null,"organisationName":"Cancer Research UK","description":"In Reverse The Odds, you help the Odds – colorful creatures whose world is falling into decline.
